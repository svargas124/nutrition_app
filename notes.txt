Recommended methodology:
To execute this project, follow these detailed steps for each stage:

Research and Data Collection:
a. Visit the USDA FoodData Central website (https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/).
b. Register for an API key to access their food database programmatically.
c. Browse the API documentation to understand how to access and search for relevant food data.
d. Identify and record the required food types, macronutrient values, and micronutrient content information.

Database Schema Design:
a. Identify the main entities and relationships for the database (e.g., users, food items, dietary preferences, etc.).
b. Create tables for each entity, defining columns for their attributes (e.g., ID, name, macronutrient values, micronutrient content, etc.).
c. Define primary keys and foreign keys to maintain referential integrity.
d. Create an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) to visualize the schema.

Setting Up the Development Environment:
a. Install Node.js, Express.js, MySQL, and required packages.
b. Create a new project folder with the necessary subfolders (e.g., frontend, backend, database, etc.).
c. Set up a version control system (e.g., Git) to track code changes and collaborate with team members.

Frontend Development:
a. Design the user interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
b. Implement a responsive design to accommodate various devices and screen sizes.
c. Create form fields for users to input their fitness goals, dietary preferences, and workout routines.
d. Implement client-side validation to ensure proper input.
e. Use AJAX to asynchronously submit user data and receive nutrition recommendations.

Backend Development:
a. Use Express.js to create a web server and define routes for handling user requests.
b. Connect to the MySQL database using a package like MySQL2 or Sequelize.
c. Create an API endpoint for submitting user data and retrieving nutrition recommendations.
d. Develop the recommendation algorithm using the collected data and user inputs. Consider factors such as fitness goals, dietary preferences, and workout routines.
e. Implement CRUD operations to manage user data and preferences in the database.

Integration:
a. Connect the frontend and backend by sending requests from the client-side to the server-side API.
b. Display the personalized nutrition recommendations on the frontend based on the server's response.

Testing and Debugging:
a. Test the web application on multiple browsers and devices to ensure compatibility.
b. Perform unit testing and integration testing to verify the functionality of individual components and their interactions.
c. Use debugging tools (e.g., browser developer tools, console logs, etc.) to identify and fix any issues.

User Documentation:
a. Create a README file to provide an overview of the project, its purpose, and features.
b. Include setup instructions, detailing the required software and steps to install and run the application.
c. Provide a user guide that explains how to navigate the application, input data, and interpret the recommendations.

Deployment:
a. Host the web application on a local server or choose a hosting service like Heroku or DigitalOcean.
b. Configure the domain and SSL certificates to secure the website.
c. Monitor the performance and usage of the application, and make adjustments as necessary.

By following these detailed steps, you'll be well-equipped to execute your personalized nutrition recommendation web application project successfully.
